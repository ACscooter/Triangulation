# Triangulation
A python3 package that implements delauney triangulation. More comments to come upon completion.


Current Contents:

 - delauney.py = base code that calculates the delauney triangulation for a grid or graph.

 - README.md = basic readme file for contents and notes to review.

 - sampler.py = randomly assigns points in a 2D euclidean space of specified length and width.
                The function spaces the points out to avoid clusters of points.

 - utils.py = Draws the randomly generated points from sampler.py onto a canvas of specified length and width.(Image, etc).

 - triangulation_notes.md = Typed up notes on theory and reasoning of code. 

 - IMG1-8 = images taken from written notes to aid with reading of triangulation_notes.md
